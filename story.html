                What is the one philosophy that drives <a href="#What makes SCAAL the best coffee?"> SCAAL </a>? We</br> 
believe that no matter where you go, you should</br>
always be able to enjoy the simple pleasure of a</br>
good cup of coffee in a comfortable environment. At</br>
home, reading the morning paper. At your local</br>
SCAAL, conversing with a confidant. Or perhaps in</br>
some foreign land, SCAAL will be greeting you like </br>
an old friend. After all, coffee is a ritual that</br>
transcends all cultural boundaries. It makes us feel</br>
alert, energetic and alive.

Anders Carlson lived a sheltered life in a small </br>
fishing village in Marstrand, Sweden. As a child, he </br>
listened to stories of his grandfather Oluf�s </br>
adventures and expeditions. Often his grandfather </br>
would bring back exotic coffees for the family to </br>
enjoy. </p>

<p>
Upon his graduation Anders left home to see the </br>
world. He worked all kinds of odd jobs. He worked in </br>
Parisian cafes and Italian espresso bars. He worked </br>
in the coffee fields of Brazil and New Guinea. And in </br>
a few years, Anders learned the art of selecting the </br>
perfect coffee bean and roasting it to perfection. </p>

<p>
He returned home in 1980 to open the first SCAAL in </br>
Stockholm, Sweden. By creating his own unique </br>
blends of coffee and a stimulating atmosphere, </br>
SCAAL quickly became the place to gather � day or </br>
night � not only in Stockholm, Sweden, but 670 </br>
cities around the world. </p>

<p>
 Anders has passed down the knowledge he learned </br>
as an apprentice in the coffee fields to every buyer, </br>
roaster, and franchise owner. SCAAL's standards for </br>
coffee are never compromised. We only select SHB � </br>
strictly hard bean or strictly high grown � coffee </br>
beans. To ensure their flavorful oils are preserved, </br>
extraordinary steps are taken to protect the coffee </br>
bean from heat, light, air and moisture. </p>

<p>
All these efforts are made so that we may offer you </br>
a perfect cup of coffee.
</p>

<p>
There are so many places you could go to buy coffee. </br>
We've gone to extraordinary efforts to ensure that </br>
SCAAL is your best choice. The quality begins at </br>
harvest. SCAAL relies on selective picking, a labor-</br>
intensive process that involves making several </br>
passes among the trees for those cherries that are </br>
perfectly ripe. Then we select top grade SHB, which </br>
stands for strictly hard bean or strictly high grown. </br>
Beans that are grown at a minimum altitude of 4,000 </br>
feet above sea level for optimum flavor. Within </br>
hours of shipping our coffee to you, the beans are </br>
roasted on-site in small batches by a Certified </br>
Roastmaster and vacuum-packed to retain its fresh </br>
taste and rich aroma. </p>
